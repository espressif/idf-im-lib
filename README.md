# ESP-IDF Installation Manager Libraries

**DEPRECATION NOTICE:** This repository is deprecated and no longer actively maintained. The core functionality for ESP-IDF installation management has been integrated into the [ESP-IDF Installation Manager GUI repository](https://github.com/espressif/idf-im-ui).

**Important:** The code previously hosted in this repository has been moved and is now part of the `EIM` project. Please refer to that repository for the latest updates and contributions.

## Why Deprecation?

To streamline the development and maintenance of the ESP-IDF installation management tools, we have consolidated the core library and cli code into the GUI repository. This allows for a more unified and efficient development process.

## What this means for you:

* **No further updates:** This repository will not receive any new features, bug fixes, or maintenance updates.
* **Use `idf-im-ui`:** For any future development, bug fixes, or feature requests related to ESP-IDF installation management, please refer to the [ESP-IDF Installation Manager GUI repository](https://github.com/espressif/idf-im-ui).
* **Existing usage:** If you are currently using this library, you are encouraged to migrate to the `eim` integrated solution.

## How to contribute (in the new location):

Contributions are still very welcome, but should now be directed to the [ESP-IDF Installation Manager GUI repository](https://github.com/espressif/idf-im-ui). You can contribute by:

* Reporting bugs
* Fixing bugs
* Suggesting new features

Please consult the contribution guidelines of the `eim` repository for specific instructions.
